Use pyglet setup to do this

what does there need to be
pyglet window set up
fragment shader for displaying
double buffer drawing
  for accumulation
  one is a HDR simple gets added to from the other
  one draws frame by frame

define material struct in both shader and python
  then have a built in in python that converts
  should be more like GPUPathTracer rather then RTIOW

same deal with shapes
  sphere
  square
  plane

TODO: 
  - check out what isotropic material even is
  - then get basic diffuse shading in
    - following RTIOW

Basic features:
  draw ground plane
  draw spheres
  choose where spheres are drawn from cpu
  camera (cpu side)
  ray traced lighting
    - not analytic
  accumulate color over frames


Advanced Features:
  - movement
  - time counter (frame time)
